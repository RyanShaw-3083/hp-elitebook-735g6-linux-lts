# HP Elitebook 735 Gen 6 Linux LTS  
For using Linux more smoothly on Elite 735-G6.  

## The Nightmare  
1. WWAN not be recognized.  
Wireless controller [0d40]: Intel Corporation XMM7360 LTE Advanced Modem [8086:7360]  

2. UVC (UV Camera) not in use.  
"Linux-Hello"  

3. Validity Sensor (Fingerprint) ... not in use.  
*That's too hard to get this goal.*  

4. The Lighting sensor ... not in use.

## The Road Path  
### 1. Counting  
'Star' this repository or leave an issue to let me known, if you also needed or are finding some solutions for using your Elitebook in the best way.  

### 2. Reverse Engineering  
Collect all the driver software(s) that feature(s) involved in Windows 10.  

### 3. Port the driver(s)  
Coding...debugging and testing.  

I will also share the solutions which I found to this repository in time.
