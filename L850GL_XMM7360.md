## About SecureBoot


## Compile and Load the Kernel Module
Thanks a lot for https://github.com/xmm7360/xmm7360-pci coding and sharing the native PCI driver of Intel XMM 7360 device!

Click the link above to clone or download the source. Compile it on your Linux, follow the steps.

Your WWAN will up on time!

## Fetch an address from your ISP

The rpc request for configurating the WWAN module will get an IP address from ISP. 
Just run it as follwing [https://github.com/xmm7360/xmm7360-pci/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/xmm7360/xmm7360-pci/blob/master/README.md)

```sh
wwan0: flags=4305<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,NOARP,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 10.215.0.122  netmask 0.0.0.0  destination 10.215.0.122
        inet6 2408:FFFF:FFF:FFF:f2:FFFF:FFFF:f569  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x0<global>
        unspec 00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00-00  txqueuelen 1000  (UNSPEC)
        RX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 0  bytes 0 (0.0 B)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```


## Routing Configuration
All things as you wish... but I got stuck on a question. "I can not access the Internet with the 4G module."
